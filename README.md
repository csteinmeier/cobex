Composed By Experience (CobEx)

---

This is an android project for the development of an interactive smartphone application for creating musical compositions which are influenced by personal experiences. The user feeds his experiences with captured impressions like pictures, feelings, sounds and melodies. These will then be analysed by pretrained machine learning models and their results will generate/modify the musical composition.
